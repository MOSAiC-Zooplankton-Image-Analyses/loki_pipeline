# MAZE Image Processing Pipeline

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/maze-image-processing-pipeline/badge/?version=latest)](https://maze-image-processing-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

The MAZE Image Processing Pipeline (MAZE-IPP) is a comprehensive tool for advanced marine biological research, integrating three specialized modules to enhance zooplankton imagery analysis:

- (Re-)Segmentation and meta-data collection of LOKI images (`maze-ipp loki`)
- Semantic segmentation of calanoid copepods (`maze-ipp semseg`)
- Fine-grained polyhierarchical identification of calanoid copepods and chaetognatha (`maze-ipp polytaxo`)
